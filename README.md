# SLS-M-Square-Specimen-Slicer
This is a custom slicer for use with a custom SLS/M Powder Bed 3D Printer for printing square specimens. 

The primary feature of the slicer is the ability to vary line spacing (Overlap) and scan speed within a single layer.

The Slicer uses an interlaced path to mitigate thermal warpage due to poor bed adhesion or absent bed adhesion.
